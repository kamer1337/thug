   # Click "Fork" on GitHub, then clone your fork:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/thug.git
   cd thug
   ```

2. **Add Upstream Remote**

   git fetch upstream
   ```

3. **Build the Project**
   ```bash

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

#### 1. Documentation (Easy - Great for Beginners!)

- **Improve Existing Documentation**
  - Fix typos and grammatical errors
  - Clarify confusing sections
  - Add missing information

- **Create New Documentation**
  - Document subsystems (see [docs/subsystems/](subsystems/))
  - Write tutorials (see [docs/tutorials/](tutorials/))
  - Create architecture diagrams
  - Add code examples

- **API Documentation**
  - Document classes and functions
  - Add usage examples
  - Explain algorithms and data structures

**Good First Issues**: Look for documentation TODOs in ROADMAP.md

#### 2. Code Comments (Easy)

- Add comments to complex code sections
- Explain algorithms and techniques
- Document function purposes and parameters
- Clarify non-obvious logic

```cpp
// Before
void UpdatePhysics(float dt)
{
    v.y -= 9.81f * dt;
    p += v * dt;
}

// After
void UpdatePhysics(float dt)
{
    // Apply gravity acceleration (9.81 m/sÂ²)
    v.y -= 9.81f * dt;
    
    // Update position using Euler integration
    p += v * dt;
}
```

#### 3. Code Analysis (Medium)

- Analyze game engine architecture
- Document algorithms and techniques
- Create flowcharts and diagrams
- Compare with modern game engines
- Write technical articles

#### 4. Bug Fixes (Medium)

- Fix compilation warnings
- Fix obvious bugs in existing code
- Improve error handling

**Note**: Always test your fixes thoroughly!

#### 5. Feature Implementation (Hard)

- Implement stub functions (see [docs/platforms/STUB_FUNCTIONS.md](platforms/STUB_FUNCTIONS.md))
- Complete Win32 implementations
- Add missing functionality
- Port subsystems to modern APIs

**Tip**: Start with simple stubs and work up to complex systems

#### 6. Testing (Medium)

- Create unit tests for existing code
- Add integration tests
- Document test procedures
- Verify cross-platform compatibility

#### 7. Build System Improvements (Medium)

- Improve CMake configuration
- Add build targets
- Fix platform-specific build issues
- Create CI/CD workflows

#### 8. Tools and Utilities (Medium-Hard)

- Asset extraction tools
- Analysis utilities
- Debugging tools
- Performance profilers

## Development Process

### Workflow

1. **Check Existing Issues/PRs**
   - Search for related issues or pull requests
   - Comment if you want to work on an issue
   - Avoid duplicate work

2. **Create an Issue (Optional but Recommended)**
   - Describe what you want to contribute
   - Discuss approach with maintainers
   - Get feedback before investing significant time

3. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   # or
   git checkout -b docs/documentation-update
   ```

4. **Make Changes**
   - Follow coding standards ([CODE_STYLE.md](CODE_STYLE.md))
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Test your changes
   - Document as you go

5. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description"
   ```

6. **Push to Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create Pull Request**
   - Go to GitHub and create a PR
   - Fill out the PR template
   - Link related issues
   - Wait for review

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Add Win32 texture loading implementation

- Implement CTexture::Load() for DirectX 8
- Add error handling for file I/O
- Support multiple texture formats
- Update documentation in WIN32.md

Fixes #123
```

Format:
- **First line**: Brief summary (50 chars or less)
- **Blank line**
- **Body**: Detailed description (wrap at 72 chars)
  - What changed
  - Why it changed
  - Any relevant context

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting a PR:

1. **Build Test**
   ```bash
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make  # or cmake --build .
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Follow the Style Guide

- Read [CODE_STYLE.md](CODE_STYLE.md)
- Match existing code style
- Use tabs for indentation
- Follow naming conventions

### Key Points

```cpp
// Good
class CExample
{
public:
    void UpdateState();
    
private:
    int m_value;
};

// Bad
class example {
  public:
    void update_state();
  private:
    int value;
};
```

### Code Quality

- **No compiler warnings** (or document why they're unavoidable)
- **Const correctness** where appropriate
- **Error handling** for failure cases
- **Memory safety** (no leaks, no buffer overruns)
- **Clear logic** (readable and maintainable)

## Documentation

### Documentation Standards

1. **Markdown Format**
   - Use standard Markdown syntax
   - Include table of contents for long documents
   - Use code blocks with language tags

2. **Clear Structure**
   - Hierarchical headings
   - Short paragraphs
   - Bullet points for lists
   - Code examples where relevant

3. **File Placement**
   - Subsystem docs: `docs/subsystems/`
   - Platform docs: `docs/platforms/`
   - Tutorials: `docs/tutorials/`
   - General docs: `docs/`

4. **Cross-References**
   - Link to related documentation
   - Use relative paths
   - Keep links up to date
