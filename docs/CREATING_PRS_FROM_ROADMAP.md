# Creating Pull Requests from Roadmap Items

This guide explains how to convert roadmap features from [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) into actionable GitHub issues and pull requests using [TASKS.md](TASKS.md).

## Quick Start

1. **Browse [TASKS.md](TASKS.md)** to find a task that interests you
2. **Create a GitHub issue** (optional but recommended) using the issue template below
3. **Follow the workflow** in [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
4. **Submit your PR** using the PR template in CONTRIBUTING.md

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Choose a Task

Browse [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) and select a task based on:

- **Your skill level** (check the Complexity rating)
- **Time available** (check the Effort estimate)
- **Your interests** (pick something you're excited about)
- **Current needs** (prioritize High priority tasks)

**Good First Tasks for Beginners:**
- Documentation tasks (most TASK-DOC-* items)
- Code quality tasks (TASK-QUALITY-001, 002, 003)
- Simple tool configuration tasks

**Intermediate Tasks:**
- Build system improvements
- Testing infrastructure
- Tool development
- Code refactoring

**Advanced Tasks:**
- Platform abstraction layer
- Graphics backend implementation
- Code modernization
- Complex tool development

### Step 2: Check for Existing Work

Before starting, check if someone is already working on it:

```bash
# Search GitHub issues
# Look for issues with the task ID or similar title

# Search recent PRs
# Check if there's an open PR for this work
```

On GitHub:
1. Go to Issues tab
2. Search for the task ID (e.g., "TASK-DOC-001")
3. Check if there's an existing issue or PR

### Step 3: Create a GitHub Issue (Recommended)

Creating an issue helps:
- Claim the task so others don't duplicate work
- Get feedback before investing time
- Track progress
- Link related discussions

**Issue Template:**

```markdown
# [TASK-XXX-NNN] Task Title

## Task Reference
From TASKS.md: TASK-XXX-NNN

## Description
[Copy the description from TASKS.md]

## Requirements
[Copy the requirements from TASKS.md]

## Files to Create/Modify
[List files from TASKS.md]

## Plan
[Outline your approach to completing this task]

## Questions
[Any questions or clarifications needed]

## Estimated Timeline
[When do you plan to have this completed?]

## Related Issues
[Link to any related issues]
```

**Example Issue:**

```markdown
# [TASK-DOC-001] Create ARCHITECTURE.md

## Task Reference
From TASKS.md: TASK-DOC-001

## Description
Create comprehensive architecture documentation explaining the overall system design.

Priority: High | Complexity: Medium | Effort: 4-8 hours

## Requirements
- Document the game engine pipeline (initialization â†’ game loop â†’ shutdown)
- Create architecture diagrams for major subsystems
- Map data flow between Core, Gel, Gfx, Sk, and Sys layers
- Explain the role of each major subsystem

## Files to Create
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

## Plan
1. Study the existing codebase structure
2. Identify major subsystems and their relationships
3. Create architecture diagrams using Mermaid or similar
4. Write comprehensive documentation
5. Get feedback from maintainers

## Questions
- Preferred diagram format? (Mermaid, SVG, PNG?)
- Desired level of detail?
- Should I include code examples?

## Estimated Timeline
Planning to complete within 1 week

## Related Issues
Related to ROADMAP.md Section 1.1
```

### Step 4: Set Up Your Branch

Follow the branching convention:

```bash
# Fork the repository (if you haven't already)
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/thug.git
cd thug

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kamer1337/thug.git

# Create a branch
# Use format: category/task-id-brief-description
git checkout -b docs/task-doc-001-architecture-md
# or
git checkout -b feature/task-build-001-modular-cmake
# or
git checkout -b fix/task-quality-005-header-guards
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**

- `docs/task-xxx-yyy` - Documentation tasks
- `feature/task-xxx-yyy` - New features
- `fix/task-xxx-yyy` - Bug fixes or improvements
- `test/task-xxx-yyy` - Testing tasks
- `build/task-xxx-yyy` - Build system tasks
- `refactor/task-xxx-yyy` - Code refactoring

### Step 5: Do the Work

Follow the requirements from TASKS.md:

1. **Make minimal, focused changes**
   - Stick to the task requirements
   - Don't mix multiple tasks in one PR
   - Keep commits logical and atomic

2. **Follow project standards**
   - Read [docs/CODE_STYLE.md](docs/CODE_STYLE.md)
   - Follow existing conventions
   - Preserve historical accuracy when modifying code

3. **Document as you go**
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Add code comments where helpful
   - Explain complex decisions

4. **Test your changes**
   - Build the project
   - Run existing tests
   - Test your new functionality
   - Verify documentation renders correctly

### Step 6: Commit Your Changes

Write clear commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "[TASK-DOC-001] Create ARCHITECTURE.md

- Document game engine pipeline
- Add architecture diagrams
- Explain subsystem relationships
- Map data flow between layers

Related to #123"
```

**Commit Message Format:**

[TASK-ID] Brief summary (50 chars or less)

- Detailed bullet points
- Explaining what changed
- And why it changed
- One change per line

Related to #issue-number
Fixes #issue-number (if applicable)
```

### Step 7: Push and Create PR

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin docs/task-doc-001-architecture-md
```

Then on GitHub:
1. Go to your fork
2. Click "Compare & pull request"

## Multiple Tasks in Sequence

If you want to work on multiple related tasks:

1. **Complete one task fully** before starting another
2. **Wait for PR to be merged** before starting dependent task
3. **Or create separate branches** for independent tasks

Example workflow:
```bash
# Task 1
git checkout -b docs/task-doc-001-architecture
# ... do work ...
git push origin docs/task-doc-001-architecture
# ... create PR, wait for review ...

# Task 2 (independent)
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b docs/task-doc-002-game-loop
# ... do work ...
```

## Task Dependencies

Some tasks depend on others. Check TASKS.md for:

- "Related" mentions
- Prerequisite requirements
- Build system dependencies

**Example Dependencies:**
- Testing tasks require test framework (TASK-TEST-001)
- Platform tasks may need HAL design (TASK-MODERN-001)
- Tool tasks may need format documentation first
