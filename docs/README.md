## Key Findings from THUG2 Research

### Architecture Similarities
- **70-80% code reuse** from THUG to THUG2
- Same engine foundation (Neversoft Engine)
- Identical core systems (GEL, Graphics, Physics)
- Compatible scripting system (QB language)
- Shared component architecture

### Major THUG2 Additions
1. **Freak Out Mode** - Enhanced special meter system
2. **Tag Graffiti** - Spray paint mechanics
3. **World Destruction** - Destructible objects
4. **Sticker Slap** - New trick type
5. **World Destruction Tour** - Tour-based story mode

### Technical Impact
- **Core Systems**: 90-100% reusable (Math, Memory, File I/O, Scripting)
- **Game Systems**: 60-80% reusable (Goals, Multiplayer, UI)
- **Content**: 30-50% new (Story scripts, Levels, Assets)

### Implementation Strategy
The modular, component-based architecture makes THUG well-suited for THUG2 extensions:
- Add new components (GraffitiComponent, FreakOutComponent)
- Extend existing systems (Trick system, Goal system)
- Add script commands for new features
- Minimal changes to core engine

## Project Context

### Original Development
- **Developer**: Neversoft Entertainment
- **Publisher**: Activision
- **THUG Release**: October 2003
- **THUG2 Release**: October 2004
- **Development Time**: ~12 months between releases

### This Repository
- **Focus**: PC-only port (console code removed)
- **Purpose**: Educational and preservation
- **State**: Source code with build infrastructure
- **Status**: Cannot build without completing Win32 stubs and adding assets

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. **Subsystem Docs**: Place in `subsystems/` directory
2. **Research**: Place in main `docs/` directory
3. **Update Index**: Add entries to this README.md
4. **Link from Main**: Update ../README.md documentation section
5. **Format**: Use Markdown with clear structure
6. **Examples**: Include code examples where relevant

### Documentation Standards

- **Clear Headers**: Use hierarchical heading structure
- **Code Examples**: Provide practical, working examples
- **File Paths**: Always specify full paths from repository root
- **Cross-References**: Link to related documentation
- **Version Info**: Note which game version (THUG, THUG2) features apply to
